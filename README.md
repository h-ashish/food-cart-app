# food-cart-app

A food cart app in which food items can be added to a cart and the cart can be viewed to add or remove more items from the cart. 
I have also given a bill component which shows us the total number of items added in the cart with an automatic discount feature. 

Modules used: ReactJs, Bootstrap, Redux, React-Redux, Axios, React-router-dom, Font-awesome.
